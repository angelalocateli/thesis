# Title: Relationship between air pollutants and respiratory diseases: analysis by spatial data clustering and temporal association rules

The present work has the general objective of applying data mining techniques to discover patterns that relate the concentration levels of atmospheric pollutants with rates of occurrence of respiratory diseases, taking into account the geolocation of the patterns and the time intervals in which the patterns happened.

This objective was systematized into specific goals. This repository has all the scripts (full view choose "Raw") and instructions to execute. 


# Repository:

- clustering/clustering_geoplot: elore how the clustering technique can contribute to the discovery of spatial and temporal patterns of pollutants in cities in the State of SÃ£o Paulo;

- association_rules: investigate, through association rules, considering the groups that present a high concentration of pollutants, co-occurrences between pollutant emission concentration, and meteorological variables in different regions;

- armada_analysis/armada_plot: design and implement an algorithm for extracting temporal association rules for multivariate series in search of frequent patterns, which include temporal intervals and their relationships;

- timeRelations/utils: analyze temporal rules that consider higher incidence multi-pollutants in the short-term relationship with the increase in hospitalizations for respiratory diseases to track the behavior of evolutionary data in discovering patterns.


# Running the scripts: 

The environment was Anaconda (Jupyter Notebook and package manager pip). Open-source, with an environmental management system for Python programs, runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. For this, you can use a docker container.

If you want to run the scripts, clone this repository in your source folder, open a terminal, and navigate to the folder where the scripts are located.

Install the necessary libraries to execute the scripts: !pip install <path>. For example: !pip install scikit-learn-extra.

All scripts require a .csv file as upload defined in the dataframe (same format). Also, a path for output files (data and graph). It is not recommended to use the same folder for different analyses.
